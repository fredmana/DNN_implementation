This is the final project in the “Numerical Optimization with Applications” given in BGU in 2019. 
Here we implement a FC (fully connected) network using either regular layer or residual layers. We demonstrate the performance and gradient correctness of these networks. We also compare between the regular and residual layers.
Placed in this folder is an HTML file containing the answers to the project.
You can find a jupyter notebook which generated the html file, along with the relevant code, in the code_and_data folder.
